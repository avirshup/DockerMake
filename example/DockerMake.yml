  A basic definition for other images to build on. Specifically, it refers to a dockerfile that needs
  to be built to provide the "FROM" field for all other images

  Step that add a temporary file to the image, then use it to create a csv file in the /data directory

  This is an example of squashing an image to remove a temporary file. Here, the
  "Puromycin.csv" file gets added to /tmp with an ADD command but is then removed in a later layer.
  By setting "squash: true", we remove intermediate layers and any files that exist only in them.
 requires:
 - data_image
 build_directory: sample_data/plant_growth
 squash: true

  ADD Puromycin.csv /tmp
  RUN cp /tmp/Puromycin.csv /data/inhibitor.csv
  RUN rm /tmp/Puromycin.csv
